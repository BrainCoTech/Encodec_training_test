Encodec training

The code of Encodec model with training.py. It is based on https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec and https://github.com/Mikxox/EnCodec_Trainer and it can execute on my local Windows system. The training set is a small part of e-gmd-v1.0.0 and can be downloaded in https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/e-gmd

The dataset should be placed in dataset/e-gmd-v1.0.0 and also the csv described where the files in should also be added to datasets/e-gmd-v1.0.0/
